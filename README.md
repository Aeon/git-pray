Inspired by a conversation in our development chat:

    James Pearson     The group around your desk has disappeared. Did a solution present itself?
    Scott Vanderlind  @James Not entirely. @Cedric offered "good luck" and @Adam said he'd look into the runtime error the switch script was throwing.
    Cedric Wienold    @Scott when in doubt, use pure git
    Daniel Beardsley  @Scott --weird... is the submodule not added correctly?
                      ya.
    Cedric Wienold    git co branch
                      git pull
                      git sm init
                      git sm update
                      git pray
